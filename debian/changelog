quilt (0.37-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release(s. I missed the 0.36, sorry):

    - japaneese translation.
    - touch files after they are restored to not confuse make and friends.
    - various bug fixes.

  * Useless cleanup in debian/rules (Closes: #268967)
  * Acknoledge NMU. Thanks Matt! (Closes: #264053)
