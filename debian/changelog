quilt (0.32-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - It is now possible to use quilt from within sub-directories of the
      working tree. Quilt will automatically find the root of the tree.
    - New 'graph' command to display neat graphics of patch dependencies.
    - 'fork' semantic reverted to previous one: the forked patch is the
      topmost one, not the next in the series.
    - documentation update.
    - man page (provided by your servitor ;)
  * Fix a typo in output of setup -l. Closes #236933
  * Rephrase package description. Closes #236221
