quilt (0.32-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * DO NOT UPGRADE IF YOU HAVE OPENNED WORKING DIRECTORIES
  * Upstream changed the meta-data in working directories (under .pc/).
    That means that if you have some working trees opened with a prior
    version, you should now stop the upgrade, run "quilt pop -a" on them, and 
    redo this upgrade.
  * I am very sorry about that, and upstream promised that such changes
    won't happen again in the future (they will introduce some sort of
    meta-data versionning next time they want to mess with it, and implement 
    some sort of automatic meta-data upgrade).
