Description: Scripts for working with series of patches
 The scripts allow to manage a series of patches by keeping
 track of the changes each patch makes. Patches can be
 applied, un-applied, refreshed, etc.
 .
 The scripts are heavily based on Andrew Morton's patch scripts
 found at http://www.zip.com.au/~akpm/linux/patches/
 .
 The key philosophical concept is that your primary output is patches.
 Not ".c" files, not ".h" files.  But patches.  So patches are the
 first-class object here.
