Description: Tool to work with series of patches
 Quilt manages a series of patches by keeping track of the changes
 each of them makes. They are logically organized as a stack, and you can
 apply, un-apply, refresh them easily by traveling into the stack (push/pop).
 .
 Quilt is good for managing additional packages applied to to a package
 received as a tarball or maintained in another version control system. The
 stacked organization proved to be efficient for the management of very
 large patch sets (more than hundred patches). As matter of fact, it was
 designed by and for linux kernel hackers (Andrew Morton, from the -mm
 branch, is the original author), and its main use by the current upstream
 maintainer is to manage the (hundreds of) patches against the kernel made
 for the SUSE distribution. 
 .
 This package completely integrates into the CDBS, allowing maintainers
 using this new paradigm for their packaging script to benefit of the quilt
 comfort when editing their diff against upstream. The package also provide
 some basic support for the fool not using CDBS (yet).

 http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/quilt is the current best approximation
 of an upstream homepage.
