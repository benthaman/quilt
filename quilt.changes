- Add syntax highlighting tags for emacs and vim.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jan 31 09:15:01 +0100 2003 - Martin.Quinson@ens-lyon.fr

- Change '#!@BASH@' to '#! @BASH@'. It can look a bit stupid, but
  it's needed for maximal portability.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jan 31 08:52:20 +0100 2003 - Martin.Quinson@ens-lyon.fr

- Fight lintian warnings (lintian is a tool to check debian
  packages):
- Remove the dependencies on essential packages diff, gzip,
  debianutils
- Format the copyright file properly
- Remove the #! /bin/bash header from patchfns, since it's not an
  executable script, but a stuff to be sourced by others.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jan 30 23:56:21 +0100 2003 - agruen@suse.de

- Also substitute @MKTEMP@.
- For improved scripting support, add -n option to scripts that
  print patch names prints the patch file name instead. This
  is useful for selecting which patches to grep, etc.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jan 30 19:02:14 +0100 2003 - agruen@suse.de

- Allow a file list to be diffed to be passed to quilt diff. Add
  -P option for specifying a patch different from the topmost
  patch,

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jan 20 12:11:00 +0500 2003 -  Martin.Quinson@ens-lyon.fr

- Remove useless oldies. Missing functionnalities needs to be
  reimplemented almost from the scratch due to the bunch of
  changes to the core since those scripts were written.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jan 30 13:25:51 +0100 2003 - agruen@suse.de
- Fix some regex quoting; use grep -E because we quote for extended
  regexps. Filenames with "+^$" in it did not work in some places. 
- Prepare for GNU Autoconf: substitute @PERL@, @BASH@, @DIFF@,
  @PATCH@ in scripts.
- Some cleanups in Makefile.
- Move documentation to doc/.
- Forgot to mention that the patches produced now contain
  `Index: dir/filename' just before the diff output for each file.
  This is required by POSIX, and is also used by diffstat.
- Adjust patch_description documentation extraction function to
  check for Index: lines.
- Quilt refresh looses text before actual patch due to but in
  patch_description function.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jan 28 23:41:19 +0100 2003 - agruen@suse.de

- Add --leave-rejects option to quilt push and apatch, to
  leave reject files around for inspection even if a patch
  does not apply.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jan 28 23:38:59 +0100 2003 - agruen@suse.de

- Restart change log at quilt-0.21. Let orderly development
  begin :)
