- Fix some regex quoting; use grep -E because we quote for extended
  regexps. Filenames with "+^$" in it did not work in some places. 
- Prepare for GNU Autoconf: substitute @PERL@, @BASH@, @DIFF@,
  @PATCH@ in scripts.
- Some cleanups in Makefile.
- Move documentation to doc/.
- Forgot to mention that the patches produced now contain
  `Index: dir/filename' just before the diff output for each file.
  This is required by POSIX, and is also used by diffstat.
- Adjust patch_description documentation extraction function to
  check for Index: lines.

- Add --leave-rejects option to quilt push and apatch, to
  leave reject files around for inspection even if a patch
  does not apply.
