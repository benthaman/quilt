At the begining was the void. Then Andrew Morton <akpm@digeo.com> begun
a collection of small scripts for patch management. The contributions
came from Stephen Cameron <steve.cameron@hp.com>, Matt Reppert
<arashi@arashi.yi.org> and Jeremy Fitzhardinge <jeremy@digeo.com>.

Then, Andreas Gruenbacher <agruen@suse.de> came to cleanup, reorganize,
document and speed up the code. He did also package it to rpm.

Finally, Martin Quinson <Martin.Quinson@tuxfamily.org> did a debian
package and came with several little patches.
